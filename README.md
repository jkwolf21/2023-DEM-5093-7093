# 2023 DEM 5093/7093
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for Population Science - Demography 5093/7093 Spring 2023*

*adapted from https://github.com/coreysparks/DEM7093

# Course Description: 
This course is designed to give graduate students interested in social science, population science and policy fields a hands-on introduction to the use of Geographic Information Systems. The course will cover geographic data types, spatial data creation and management, exploratory spatial statistical analysis, and the basics of geospatial analysis. At the close of the course, students will be able to use R and QGIS to create and modify geographic data, perform descriptive analysis of spatial data and integrate and map data from various sources into the GIS environment.

# Computer Skills: 
We will be using Quantum GIS (QGIS) version 3.28 and R version 4.2.2 for this course.

QGIS is open source and free and can be downloaded for windows or mac (OSX > 10.13) from here: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

R (https://cran.r-project.org/) is the language in which most research statisticians work and current methodological developments are being made, it is also free and can be used on any operating system. Please update your R version 4.2.2 to the latest release and update all your packages.

Dr. Sparks created a two-day R Bootcamp for beginners you can view here if you’d like:

# RStudio and RPubs: 
We will use R through RStudio (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and we will use RPubs (https://rpubs.com/) for creating all assignments (assignments will be turned in via Blackboard).

For those of you interested in R, Dr. Corey Sparks has published all of the examples from this class, and his other classes to his RPubs site: http://rpubs.com/corey_sparks, so you can follow along with that stuff if you choose. I am currently updating mine with this course’s content: https://rpubs.com/jkwolf21.

# RTools: 
You should also install version 4.2 install of RTools if you are a windows user (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

# R Packages: 
Copy and paste the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use in this class:
